		<p class="ps8">This program is a desktop application to be used by primary school educators and staff to record student enrollment, attendance, and assignment completion. In addition, student assessment grades are recorded and a letter grade assigned for each course based on the calculated average of the student’s grade.</p>
		<p class="ps8">Access to the application’s functions is controlled by the user’s roles setting and only granted if their user role has the adequate permissions. User roles will also limit what data a user can edit and what student personal information is viewable.</p>
		<p class="ps8">Reporting functions of the application will include student progress reports, course evaluations to give teachers an overview of the class’s progress as a whole, student profiles, and school enrollment reports.</p>
